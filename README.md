RubyGems is a package management framework for Ruby.

This gem is an update for the RubyGems software. You must have an
installation of RubyGems before this update can be applied.

See Gem for information on RubyGems (or `ri Gem`)

To upgrade to the latest RubyGems, run:

```
  $ gem update --system  # you might need to be an administrator or root
```

See [UPGRADING](UPGRADING.rdoc) for more details and alternative instructions.

-----

If you don't have RubyGems installed, you can still do it manually:

* Download from: https://rubygems.org/pages/download, unpack, and cd there
* OR clone this repository and cd there (make sure to run `git submodule update -\-init`)
* Install with: ruby setup.rb  # you may need admin/root privilege

For more details and other options, see:

```
  ruby setup.rb --help
```
